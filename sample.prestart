# This file is run before a swatch instance starts. If you need a place to put
# initialization code, this file is it.
# Existence of this file is optional. If it doesn't exist, executing it won't
# be attempted.
# However if it does exist, it needs to be a proper executable file (+x set)
# and it needs to exit without errors. If it exits with errors, systemd
# will treat this as an error and refuse to run the swatch binary.
